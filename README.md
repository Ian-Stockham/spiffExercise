# spiffExercise
A repository containing my implementation of a progress bar using react as a part of the spiff technical interview process

Had I more time I most certainly would have liked to make a number of changes to this project.  Primarily I wish that I had more
time to implement the button design.  Other than this I would have loved to make it so the progress bar did not jump in such a step-wise
manner.  It also would have been nice to make it so when the finish button is pressed the pause/resume option for a button dissappears.
